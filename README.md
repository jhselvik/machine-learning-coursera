# machine-learning-coursea

Implementing Coursea's [Machine Learning](https://www.coursera.org/learn/machine-learning) labs in python.

Mostly me walking through jdwittenauer's [blog posts](https://www.johnwittenauer.net/machine-learning-exercises-in-python-part-1/)
and adding my own annotations for future reference. Additional help from [JWarmenhoven's](https://github.com/JWarmenhoven/Coursera-Machine-Learning)
and [kaleko's](https://github.com/kaleko/CourseraML) repos.
